# Kaggle_Google_QUEST_QA_Labeling
This is a Kaggle Competition started on Dec. 21 2019. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview

In this competition, we need to use a new dataset to build predictive algorithms for different subjective aspects of question-answering. The question-answer pairs were gathered from nearly 70 different websites, in a "common-sense" fashion. 

There are a list of 30 target labels, which are the same as the column names in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Target labels with the prefix `question_` relate to the `question_title` and/or `question_body` features in the data. Target labels with the prefix `answer_` relate to the answer feature.

Each row contains a single question and a single answer to that question, along with additional features. The training data contains rows with some duplicated questions (but with different answers). The test data does not contain any duplicated questions.

This is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0,1]. Therefore, predictions must also be in that range. Also, we could see from EDA, values are not literally continuous. It is divided into about nine values, like 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 etc.

Submissions are evaluated on the mean column-wise [Spearman's correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient). The Spearman's rank correlation is computed for each target column, and the mean of these values is calculated for the submission score.

### Github Tutorial
If you are not really familiar with how to connect github with your local git or having problems with creating pull requests or branches, there is a simple github tutorial, it might be helpful. 

And if on the contrary, you are very familiar with github and think there should be more in the tutorail, feel free to add more.
